## What Is Meditation?

Meditation is the practice of focusing your mind to achieve a state of calm and awareness. It can take many forms, from seated mindfulness exercises to guided visualizations, and its roots span cultures and traditions. At its core, meditation is about slowing down, turning your attention inward, and cultivating a sense of inner peace.

### The Key Elements of Meditation

1. **Focus**: Meditation involves concentrating on a specific object, thought, or activity, such as your breath or a mantra.
2. **Awareness**: Mindfulness—the act of being fully present in the moment—is central to meditation.
3. **Non-Judgment**: Meditation encourages observing your thoughts and emotions without judgment, creating space for clarity.

## What Is Mindfulness?

Mindfulness is a form of meditation that emphasizes being fully present in the current moment. Rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, mindfulness teaches you to focus on the here and now.

### How Does Mindfulness Differ from Meditation?

While meditation is a broader practice, mindfulness is a specific type of meditation that integrates awareness into daily life. For example:
- **Mindful Meditation**: Sitting quietly and focusing on your breathing.
- **Mindful Living**: Paying attention to everyday actions, like savoring a meal or noticing the sensation of water when washing your hands.

Mindfulness can be practiced anytime, anywhere—apps like **Calm** and **Headspace** offer tools to help you incorporate mindfulness into your routine.
